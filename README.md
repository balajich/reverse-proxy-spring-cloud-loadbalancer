# Spring Cloud Gateway -Reverse proxy with Spring Cloud Load Balancer
In this tutorial we are going to learn how to use Spring Cloud Load Balancer for client side load balancing as Netflix ribbon in maintenance mode  

- Overview
    - Gateway runs on port 8080
    - Requests on 8080 are reverse proxied (forwarded) to  rest api running on 9090 and 9091
    - Eureka Registry Server is running on port 8761
    - When Gateways starts up on port 8080 registers with Eureka Registry
    - When rest api servers starts on 9090 and 9091 register with Eureak Server
    - Spring Cloud gateway uses Spring Cloud Load Balancer and routes all the requests that are coming on 8080 in a round robin fashion to 9090 and 9091
    - When are new rest api instance starts on 9092 it registers with Eureka and routing is dynamically enabled by Gateway 
    - New application servers can be dynamically added
    - Application servers (service urls) are maintained in Registry
    - Netflix Eureka component plays a role of registry
    - Spring Cloud Load Balancer plays a role of Client side load balancer
    - Netflix Eureka Client is included in all the application servers (services)  and Gateway
# Source Code 
    git clone https://github.com/balajich/reverse-proxy-spring-cloud-gateway-enhanced-routing.git
# Source Code - Dynamic Routing
    git clone https://github.com/balajich/reverse-proxy-spring-cloud-gateway-registry.git
# Architecture
# Prerequisite
- JDK 1.8 or above
- Apache Maven 3.6.3 or above
# Clean and Build
    mvn clean install
# Running components
- Registry: java -jar .\registry\target\registry-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Gateway:  java -jar .\gateway\target\gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Rest API instance 1: java -jar .\restapi\target\restapi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Rest API instance 2:  java -jar '-Dserver.port=9091' .\restapi\target\restapi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
# Using curl to test environment
- Access rest api via gateway:  curl http://localhost:8080/
- Access rest api directly on instance1 : curl http://localhost:9090/
- Access rest api directly on instance2 : curl http://localhost:9090/
# Whats next?
- Netflix component (Ribbon) is currently under maintenance mode user should move to Spring Cloud Loadbalancer
- Currently, there are several applications using Netflix Ribbon for Dynamic Routing that the reason this tutorial explaining routing using Ribbon
- Note Netflix eureka is not in maintenance  mode
